Project Proposal - Cat Trax
Story: Generate e-collectible cat cards
Features: User would roll the dice with a click this would generate a name based on two arrays of quirky names. This would generate an avatar and stats (meowability, feline ferocity, cuddle power) in a Cat card format. Submit would save the card to a particular username that they type in to track who has which card(s).
API: https://cataas.com/#/
Challenges: Potentially recalling the posted owners of particular cards
Requirements: The requisite event listeners, etc. will be inherent in the program. The initial plan will be for users to save the cards locally, but may incorporate json-server to simulate persistent database updates.
